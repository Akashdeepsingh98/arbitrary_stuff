- Q1 - Find maximum subarray in an array in O(nlogn) time.

- Q2 - Find maximum subarray in an array in O(n^2) time.

- Q3 - Strassen's Matrix Multiplication in O(n^log7) time. It is a quick and dirty implementation and could not be optimized further. Plus inputs need to be n*n square matrices and n is a power of 2. Padding needs to be implemented if you want.

- Q4 - Sentinel Linear search. Instead of checking for i < n on every loop of linear search and then checking if it is the wanted key, place a sentinel value at A[ n-1] and loop till you hit it or the key. The amount of condition checks is nearly halved.

- Q5 - Iterative Linear Search.

- Q6 - Good old selection sort.
- Q7 - Good old quicksort. Last element is the pivot.

- Q8 - Counting sort.

- Q9 - Radix sort.

- Q10 - Topological Sort
- Q11 - Diameter of binary tree
- Q12 - Max heap
- Q13 - Heapsort
- Q14 - Priority queue using heap.
- Q15 - bucket sort
- Q16 - Quickselect
- Q17 - Median of medians select.
- Q18 - Maximum subarray in O(n).
- Q19 - Binary search using jumps.
- Q20 - N-queens backtracking.
